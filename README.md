## About

superdisplay is my second attempt at building a barebones rendering pipeline, and it is the first project I'm uploading with GitHub. This project is being written in C++ with help from the SDL3 development library for it's user input and window/rendering capabilities.

My first attempt building a rendering pipeline went South quickly because I didn't have a clear understanding of how the basics of rendering work. I'm still fuzzy on a few topics as of writing this, but my understanding of the vector math required is in the right spot.
